Each portion of the test file is length-prefixed with a four byte integer.  The endianness is determined
by the host system, usually little-endian.

The first portion of the file is an ASCII list of unit test information.  Each entry is as follows:
ASSEMBLER [name]: The name of the assembler that created this.  Organic is "ORGANIC".
PREREQ [name]: Defines the start of a prereq section.  The default section is NONE.
TEST [address]-[endaddress] [name]: Defines a test section
ASSERT [address] [expression]: Assertion statement

The next section is binary data.  The data is the output from assembly, in big-endian.

The last section is an ASCII listing that continues to the end of the file.
